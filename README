Install virtualbox 
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Install vagrant
    http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads

Create a location for your vm
    > mkdir ~/webserver

Clone the vagrant setup repo
    > cd ~/webserver
    > git clone git@github.com:marrone/vagrant-lamp.git

Provision your VM
    > vagrant up

Install latest guest-additions plugin
    > vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

Once it is up and running, you can ssh into the vm
    > vagrant ssh

You can connect to mysql without ssh'ing into the box from your mac host:
    > mysql -uroot -h localhost --protocol=TCP -P 33066
If that doesnt work, you might need to manually edit the my.cnf file
    > vagrant ssh
    > sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf
    > comment out the lines that start with "bind-address" and "skip-external-locking"
    > sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart

Shared directories from your Mac host to the vagrant box include:
    - ~/webserver => /vagrant
    - ~/projects => /vagrant_projects

Assuming you have the blackjack repo checked out at ~/projects/blackjack/trunk/website...
Basic steps for installing Blackjack, post-vm setup
    > sudo echo "192.168.33.10 blackjack.local.dev.pch.com" >> /etc/hosts
    > vagrant ssh
    > mysql -uroot
    > create database blackjack; exit;
    > mysql -uroot blackjack < <PATH_TO_DB_DUMP>
    > sudo apache2ctl restart
    > exit
You can then hit http://blackjack.local.dev.pch.com from your host machine
